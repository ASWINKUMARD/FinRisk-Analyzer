# 💰 FinRisk-Analyzer

# 🧠 Project Overview

- This project predicts whether a borrower will default on a loan using historical financial and demographic data.
- We compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to determine which model performs best in predicting loan defaults.

# 📂 Dataset

🔹 CSV dataset containing features like income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant financial data.
🔹 Target variable: default (0 = No Default, 1 = Default)

# 🛠️ Implementation Steps

1️⃣ Load dataset and check for missing values
2️⃣ Encode categorical variables (if any)
3️⃣ Split dataset into train and test sets
4️⃣ Scale numeric features using StandardScaler
5️⃣ Train models:

# 🌳 Random Forest

# ⚡ XGBoost

# 🔹 Logistic Regression (baseline)
6️⃣ Make predictions and evaluate models
7️⃣ Visualize feature importance for Random Forest

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics

✅ Accuracy
✅ Precision, Recall, F1-score
✅ Confusion Matrix
✅ ROC Curve (optional)

# 🔍 Key Learnings

✨ Ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost generally outperform a single Logistic Regression.
✨ Feature importance highlights key predictors of loan default.
✨ This project demonstrates a typical ML workflow from preprocessing to evaluation.
